React project built during the third week of PeopleTech Group internship. User selects products from a UI, displaying additional information about selected products. Populates information dynamically based on which products selected, to compare items with. 

The application was a lesson in propogating props and state up and down the component tree, and creating class components to handle state to drive the interactivey of the app.
